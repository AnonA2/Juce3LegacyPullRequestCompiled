Seriously right now I am downloading Snow Leopard to run xcode 3.1.2 on virtual machine to compile JUCE 3 to work natively (I need to compile demo and introjucer by clicking run ???) since xcode 4 is giving me errors: 
Ok... While I am starting this thread the JuiceDemo has compiled...
What I have done to archieve it:
Install xcode 4
Install xcode 3.2.5.
Install SDK IOS component for xcode 4

It's so arrogant for users of old mobos!!!!
All releases should be available precompiled in releases on github. Do I use original mac to install hackintosh on it for poorly working 32 bit components or use these pesky hypervisiors type II? Is there way to temporarly change system label from 10.7.5 to 10.9 so oldest compilable via xcode 4 refit will install (or it's only for 64 bit instruction set kernel only...). Anyone has it precompiled ? 
Also apart from topic can Refit hard brick my EFI via unwanted flash or it's works like in pc where I can change efi as I like.
